# ðŸ“ˆ ZIDIO Stock Forecasting Dashboard

This project applies various time series forecasting techniques to predict stock market trends using real-world financial data. The models are compared based on performance metrics and visualized through an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

---

## ðŸ§  Project Objectives
- Understand time series concepts: trend, seasonality, noise.
- Preprocess and visualize historical stock market data.
- Implement and compare ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM models.
- Evaluate performance using RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² Score.
- Deploy results through a fully interactive dashboard.

---

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack & Tools
- **Python**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn**, **Statsmodels**
- **Facebook Prophet**, **Keras/TensorFlow** (for LSTM)
- **Streamlit** (dashboard)

## ðŸ“¦ Dataset
- Source: `AAPL.csv` (Apple stock data)
- Columns: Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume
- Range: 2015â€“2024 (daily)

## ðŸ“Š Models Implemented

| Model    | RMSE    | MAE     | RÂ² Score |
|----------|---------|---------|----------|
| ARIMA    | 69.37   | 63.38   | -5.03    |
| SARIMA   | 55.78   | 51.03   | -2.90    |
| Prophet  | 38.32   | 31.40   | -0.84    |
| **LSTM** | **10.63** | **8.86** | **0.84** |

âœ… **Best Model: LSTM** â€“ Lowest RMSE and Highest RÂ²
